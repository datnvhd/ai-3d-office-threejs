# My Office 3D — Three.js prototype

Interactive isometric AI office with clickable agents, task assignment form, simulated progress, camera orbit and zoom.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local Vite address shown in your terminal.

## Claude Code connection

The top bar shows whether the app is connected to Claude Code. The dev server (`server/claude-bridge.js`) finds the Claude Code CLI (`CLAUDE_BIN`, `PATH`, `~/.local/bin`, or the VS Code extension's bundled binary) and exposes `/api/claude/*`:

- **Đăng nhập qua web** runs `claude setup-token` in a pseudo-terminal, which opens the Claude sign-in page. When sign-in finishes (or the code shown on the page is pasted into the dialog), the long-lived token is captured, verified with a one-line `claude -p` call, and saved to `~/.ai-3d-office/claude-auth.json`.
- The token stays on the server machine; the browser only sees a masked value. The API answers only requests from `localhost` and requires the `X-AI-Office` header on writes.
- Use the token only to run Claude Code (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=<token> claude -p ...`); `getSavedClaudeToken()` in `server/claude-bridge.js` reads it for a future task runner.

## Important

This is a front-end prototype. Tasks are simulated locally and **not** sent to Claude Code or another LLM. To integrate a real agent backend, replace the interval-based progress simulation in `src.js` with REST/WebSocket calls to an orchestrator, and bind each agent to an authenticated isolated execution environment.
